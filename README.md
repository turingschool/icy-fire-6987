## Overview
Order Up is an app that tracks chefs, the dishes that they make, and the ingredients that are in those dishes. Chefs have many dishes. Dishes belong to a chef. Dishes have many Ingredients and Ingredients have many dishes. Ingredients should have a name and calories.
 
Two migrations have been made for you, through which the one-to-many relationship has been set up. You will need to create migrations for the many-to-many relationship between Ingredients and Dishes. 
You do not need to do model testing for validations, just make sure you test any relationships and model methods that you create.
 
(Note: The plural of dish is dishes. The plural of chef is chefs.)
